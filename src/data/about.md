# Intro

I am a Graduating Student at [AinShams University](https://eng.asu.edu.eg), Former FullStack Developer at [Femesty], I have an experience in React-Native and PHP(Symfony). I am particularly interested in projects that touch finance and macro economics, sports science, social impact, and data science in general. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Femesty, I have learned how to work in teams, explore many stacks, develop relationships with others,, and build software applications with technologies like [React-Native](https://React-Native.com/), [symfony](https://symfony.com/), [directus](https://directus.com/), and [AWS](https://aws.com/). I primarily work as a React-Native Engineer but have broad experience across many stacks.

# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1996 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were prince of persia, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry.

- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.

- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years.

- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.

- 15 - 19, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, crusader kings , and Age of Empires II.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
