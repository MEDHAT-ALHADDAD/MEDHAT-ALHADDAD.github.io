I am particularly interested in projects that touch finance and macro economics, sports science, social impact, and data science in general. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt Femesty, I have learned how to work in teams, explore many stacks, develop relationships with others,, and build software applications with technologies like [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [symfony](https://symfony.com/), [directus](https://directus.io/), and [AWS](https://aws.com/). I primarily work as a React-Native Engineer but have broad experience across many stacks.\n\n# Some history\n\n- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1996 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were prince of persia, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry.\n\n- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.\n\n- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents).\n\n- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.\n\n- 15 - 19, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, crusader kings , and Age of Empires II.\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Fishing\n- Parachuting\n- Sailing and the sea\n- History\n- Summer\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am originally from Cairo, Egypt.\n- I've been to ~ 3 countries, I hope one day to visit all countries in the world.\n- I am an MineCraft enthusiast.\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I have a list of thousands of ideas, like creating a new economic Theory.\n- I can locate 90% of the countries on a map, and know a little bit about the History of each one.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- always finding inspiration.\n- enabling a brighter future.\n- doing better.\n\n# Websites from people I admire\n\n- [David J.
